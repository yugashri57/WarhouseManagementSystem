# WarhouseManagementSystem
Problem Statement: 
Design and implement a Java console application for a Warehouse Operations 
system that manages items, locations, pick lists, packs, shipments, and carrier 
dispatches. The application should demonstrate object-oriented principles and 
maintain accurate inventory and fulfillment status.

How to compile and run:
Clone the repository and move into the project folder:
    git clone https://github.com/yugashri57/WarhouseManagementSystem.git
    cd WarhouseManagementSystem
Compile and run the project:
 compile: javac com/kce/warhouse/**/*.java
 Run: java com.kce.warhouse.main.MainClass  
This will start the console-based **Warehouse Management System**.
